### Flassh Connect

Flassh Connect is bridge software between your Canon DSLR camera and the Flassh Booth software. It handles all interactions with the camera hardware. [Download now](https://flassh.co/download/connect/windows/latest)

### Flassh Booth

Flassh Booth is the Windows-based application where your photo booth runs. It is the interface that guests interact with when taking photos at your event. [Download now](https://flassh.co/download/booth/windows/latest)

#### Why do I need to download two apps?

We know it's not ideal to need both, and we're looking into the possibility of combining them into a single application. In the meantime, you'll need both to run an event. Sorry!

## Camera configuration

We recommend a small aperture and a fast shutter speed camera configuration with a high-powered flash. This keeps as much as possible in focus and ensures that changes in light (sunlight / event lighting) over time do not cause drastic changes in photo consistency.

Example values to use as a starting point:

* Aperture: F10
* Shutter Speed: 1/160
* ISO: 400

### Camera date and time

Make sure your camera's date and time are correct and that the time matches the current time in your organization's timezone. Mismatched organization timezone and camera settings can cause odd behavior as we rely on the date/time in each photo's EXIF metadata.

If you're using multiple booths (multiple cameras) in a single event, make sure the cameras are synced as close to the second as possible. If they're not the same (or very close), photos will not appear in their expected sequence in the app and online galleries.
