title: Flassh iOS
---

Flassh iOS is the preferred way to view and share photos taken with Flassh Booth. Not only can account owners login and manage their events and photos with this app, they can also send guests to download and install this app on their own devices. Guests can then instantly view and share photos from their own iPhone or iPad.

This app can also act as a [public kiosk](#kiosk-mode) for your events.

## Download and install

Grab our iOS app [free on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flassh/id997489106?mt=8).

## Sign into your Flassh account

## Kiosk mode

Open the app and make sure you're signed in, then open the event so you're looking at the listing of photos within that event. Then, you can do a single-finger long-press on the top navigation bar to enable kiosk mode, which does a few things:

- It prevents backing out of the current event, so guests are forced to stay in the context of the current event.
- It removes all sharing options except for email, since none of the other sharing options make sense on a public device.
- It hides the event edit button as well as the trash can icon so guests cannot edit event details or delete photos.
- It disables [the menu available from a long-press gesture](#single-photo-actions) available on individual photos
- It ensures the iPad/iPhone does not go to sleep (screen will stay bright and it won't lock). Combine this with Guided Access mode provided by iOS and you can completely prevent people from exiting the kiosk.

Do a single-finger long-press on the top navigation bar again to exit kiosk mode, where you'll be prompted to enter your password.

### Prevent exiting the app with Guided Access

iOS ships with a feature called Guided Access that can temporarily restrict your iOS device to a single application. Tapping the home button or the power button will keep the application open, preventing kiosk guests from exiting to the home screen or opening other applications.
