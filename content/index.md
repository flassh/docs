- Canon DSLR Camera [see supported cameras]({{< relref "booth/index.md#supported-cameras" >}})
- iPhone or iPad with iOS 9 or newer (optional)

## Understanding pricing

Our pricing is simple: **$39 per live event**.

You can buy as many credits as you need from your [billing page](https://flassh.co/account/billing). Event credits never expire.

When you create a new event, it starts out as a test event. You can create as many events as you want and you won't ever be charged for them. Test events are completely free and never expire.

### Test event limitations

- You can capture and upload up to 25 photos
- Only devices signed into your account can see a test event and its photos, it is not publicly searchable in the apps or client gallery

### Converting to a live event

When you're ready to run your live event, we'll deduct a pre-paid event credit from your account.

When you tap the "Run" button from Flassh Booth, you're prompted to "Convert To Live" or "Continue Testing". Choosing "Convert To Live" will instantly make the event live, removing all test event limitations. At that point, you can capture and upload unlimited photos to that event for 24 hours.

Once an event is live, it is publicly searchable and viewable from any device. Want to run a private live event? [Learn more about event settings]({{< relref "booth/index.md#" >}})

### Renewing an expired event

Planning an event that spans multiple days (more than 24 hours)? When an event is expired, Flassh Booth will give you the option to renew the event, which will deduct an additional event credit.
